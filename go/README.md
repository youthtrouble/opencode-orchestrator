# orch: Go runtime of the orchestrator

`orch` is one static binary whose subcommands replace `orchestrator/bin/*.mjs` one for one. The
port is incremental (plan: `.orchestrator/plans/go-port.md`); until it is complete the JS runtime
stays the default and both share the same `.orchestrator/` state.

Implemented so far (the rest of `bin/*.mjs` is still JS-only):

| Command | Replaces | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `orch version` | — | Release number plus VCS revision. |
| `orch usage [--refresh] [--json]` | `bin/usage.mjs` | Byte-identical output; reads and writes the same usage cache, so either runtime can read what the other wrote. A failed vendor reading (a 429 from the Claude usage endpoint, a codex error) is replaced by the last good cached one, marked `last_good_at` (when it was read) and `read_error`, if the cache was written less than 30 minutes ago. The window rolls: each failed refresh rewrites the cache, so refreshes that keep failing less than 30 minutes apart keep a reading of any age (as in the JS); check `last_good_at`. |
| `orch routing [--refresh \| --cached] [--json]` | `getRouting()` in `lib/usage.mjs` | The routing prompt text, or `{usage, registry, channels, resolved, prompt}` with `--json`. `--cached` never collects and exits 3 when there is no cache; bad flags exit 2. |
| `orch budget gate --vendor anthropic\|openai [--force] [--frontier]` | `budgetGate()` in `lib/budget.mjs` | Compact `{allowed, level, resets_at, note}`; exit 0 whether or not the work is allowed, 2 on bad flags or an unknown vendor. |
| `orch effort --role ROLE [--size SIZE]` | `effortFor()` in `lib/routing.mjs` | The effort-policy value as plain text, or `null`; exit 2 on bad flags or without `--role`. |
| `orch mailbox post\|list\|ack\|reply\|inbox` | `bin/mailbox.mjs` | Byte-identical output and `.orchestrator/mailbox/*.jsonl` lines (one `write` per line on an append-only descriptor, so concurrent JS and Go appenders do not interleave). `post --json` prints the whole message instead of `{id, at}` (PE-3). Uncaught JS errors print only their error line (see "Crash output and parity exceptions"). |
| `orch manifest create\|verify\|diff` | `bin/manifest.mjs` | Byte-identical output, exit codes and manifest files: the same walk (symlinks, FIFOs and other non-regular entries inside a walked directory are skipped and never opened; an explicit symlink argument is followed), UTF-16 key order and `manifest_sha256`. Uncaught JS errors print only their error line. |

The hidden `orch json-echo [--indent N]` exists for the parity harness. The plugin does not call
`orch` yet.

## Build

Go 1.25+, no third-party dependencies, no cgo.

```sh
cd go
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/orch ./cmd/orch
./scripts/build-all.sh   # dist/orch_<version>_<os>_<arch> for darwin/linux x arm64/amd64 + checksums.txt
```

Linux binaries are fully static. macOS binaries built with cgo off still link `libSystem`, which
the Go runtime requires on darwin; that is as static as a macOS binary gets. `bin/` and `dist/` are
gitignored.

The release number lives in `internal/version/VERSION` (embedded). `orch version` appends the
VCS revision Go records at build time, e.g. `0.5.0 (5ae996b)` or `0.5.0 (5ae996b+dirty)`.

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ORCH_HOME` | `~/.config/opencode/orchestrator` | The orchestrator tree (the JS `ROOT`). |
| `ORCH_REGISTRY` | `$ORCH_HOME/models.json` | The model registry. |
| `HOME` | OS user home if unset/empty | Per-user state lives in `~/.local/state/opencode/orchestrator`. |

## Checks

```sh
cd go
go build ./... && go vet ./... && test -z "$(gofmt -l .)" && go test ./...
go vet -tags parity ./parity
./parity/run.sh --only json,usage,mailbox,manifest   # chosen parity groups; ./parity/run.sh runs them all
```

`.github/workflows/go.yml` runs build, vet, gofmt, tests and the `json`, `mailbox` and `manifest` parity groups on macOS and Linux
with `CGO_ENABLED=0` and Node installed. Malformed prompt byte tests also compare against Node
when it is available; fixed byte expectations run even without Node.

## Parity harness

`parity/run.sh` builds `bin/orch`, then runs `go test -tags parity ./parity`. Each case runs the
JS and `orch` with the same argv-equivalent and stdin, each in a fresh temp `HOME` and a fresh
project directory containing `.git/`, with an environment of only `HOME`, `PATH`, `ORCH_HOME` and
`ORCH_REGISTRY`. `PATH` is `parity/fakes` (stand-ins for `claude`, `codex`, `opencode` and `security` that
fail unless a case scripts them, so no case reads the real keychain or calls a real endpoint), then the directories of `node` and `sqlite3`. Exit codes, stdout,
stderr and every file under the project `.orchestrator/` and the HOME state dir must match.

Groups:

- `json`: JSON.stringify compatibility over `testdata/json/*.json` and the checkout's
  `models.json`, compact and indent 2.
- `usage`: `orch usage` against `bin/usage.mjs` over the cache fixtures in
  `testdata/usage/parity-caches.json` and over channel sources (sqlite, `opencode auth list`,
  `auth.json`); re-collection through the scripted codex app-server fake, including the
  last-good cases; the cache round trip in both directions; and `routing`, `budget gate` and
  `effort` against the JS functions they replace. Only `generated_at` is normalised, and only
  when a collection happened.
- `mailbox`: every `orch mailbox` subcommand against `bin/mailbox.mjs` over seeded mailboxes
  (duplicate and `by`-less acks, duplicate ids, hand-edited lines of every JSON shape), all
  filters and `--limit` forms, stdin bodies and raw argv with malformed UTF-8, `--root` and
  `ORCHESTRATOR_PROJECT`, the inbox limit applied before its recipient filter. Fresh uuid v4
  ids, millisecond ISO timestamps and the `replied (xxxxxxxx)` prefix are normalised only
  in newly appended record fields and their write receipts, with exact format checks.
  Seeded records, read-only output and literal user content are compared unchanged.

- `manifest`: `orch manifest` against `bin/manifest.mjs` over a seeded tree holding every
  ignored directory name (as a directory and as a file), NFC/NFD, private-use and astral names
  (UTF-16 order), index-like names, a root `__proto__` file, symlinks to files and directories, a
  symlink loop and a FIFO; explicit ignored directories and symlink arguments, broken symlinks,
  `--root` with `../x`, duplicates, `--baseline`, `--out` outside `.orchestrator`; verify and
  diff over hand-made manifests of every shape (prototype keys such as `constructor`, arrays,
  strings, null). Only `created_at` is normalised, in its exact place and format.

A case can add environment entries (`env`), compare files outside `.orchestrator/`
(`extraFiles`) and declare that it ends in an uncaught JS exception (`crash`, below).

## Crash output and parity exceptions

Where the JS dies of an uncaught exception, Node prints a source excerpt, `<Name>: <message>`,
a stack and its version, and exits 1. `orch` exits 1 after the same stdout and file writes and
prints only the error line:

- C1, fixed messages (`Error: no message with id zz`, `Error: post needs from and subject`,
  filesystem errors such as EISDIR/ENOTDIR/EACCES, ...): each case pins the expected error
  line; the harness requires that exact nonempty line as `orch`'s entire stderr and as a
  whole line in Node's stderr, with exit 1 from both. Filesystem errnos outside the 20
  that `orch` spells as Node does (EACCES, EEXIST, EISDIR, ELOOP, ENOENT, ENOTDIR, ...) print
  Go's own error text instead; that difference is known and not asserted.
- C1 also covers Node's own coded and type errors with fixed text, such as
  `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined`
  (`manifest verify` without a file) and `TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object`
  (a manifest without `files`). Paths in these messages use the physical working directory, as
  `process.cwd()` does, not `$PWD`.
- C2, malformed hand-edited state (a message whose `kind` is not a string, `refs` missing, ...):
  both stderrs must contain a line starting `TypeError: `; V8's wording is not reproduced.

The other documented differences, each asserted by its own parity case:

- PE-1: a UTF-16 slice that splits a surrogate pair (the reply subject cut at 140 units, the inbox
  body at 400) or a string message spread into one key per code unit gives U+FFFD in Go. Text
  output is identical (Node prints a lone surrogate as U+FFFD); JSON escapes differ: the JS writes
  `"\ud83d"`, `orch` the raw U+FFFD.
- PE-2: the crash output above. A manifest file that `JSON.parse` rejects prints a
  `SyntaxError: ` line in both runtimes; the message after the class differs.
- PE-3: `orch mailbox post --json` prints the whole message it appended; the JS ignores
  `--json`. As in `list`, only a bare `--json` counts (`--json x` is the value of a key).

`ORCH_JS=/path/to/orchestrator ./parity/run.sh` compares against another JS tree.

## JSON compatibility

All JSON `orch` writes goes through `internal/jsjson`, which matches Node's `JSON.stringify` byte
for byte: JS property order (canonical array-index keys first, ascending, then insertion order),
ES number formatting, and no escaping of `/ < > &`, U+2028, U+2029 or non-ASCII text. The single
known divergence: a lone UTF-16 surrogate escape (`"\ud800"`) parses to U+FFFD, because a Go
string cannot hold it.

Prompt files, stdin and mailbox argv are decoded like Node's UTF-8 Buffer decoding: malformed sequences
become U+FFFD (an incomplete multi-byte prefix produces one replacement). `jsjson.Unmarshal`
uses `encoding/json`, which replaces invalid input bytes rather than passing them through;
its malformed-sequence grouping is not a claim of Node Buffer decoding parity. `Marshal` and
`MarshalIndent` reject invalid UTF-8 Go strings, object keys and indentation with
`jsjson.ErrInvalidUTF8`, returning no JSON bytes. Decode raw text at its input boundary first.

## Usage feeds

`internal/usage` mirrors `lib/usage.mjs`, `lib/claude-usage.mjs` and `lib/codex-appserver.mjs`.
`internal/budget` mirrors `lib/budget.mjs`. External programs are found on `PATH`, as in the JS:
`security` (macOS keychain, 30 s timeout), `sqlite3` and `opencode` (channel detection), and
`codex app-server` (JSON-RPC, 20 s). The Claude usage request sends Node's fetch headers. Known
JS defects are mirrored on purpose. They are listed in the S3 report, together with the
malformed-input cases that are not mirrored.

Two lifecycle details deliberately differ from the JS without changing any output or cache byte.
A `codex app-server` child that ignores SIGTERM is killed after a 1 s grace and reaped before
`orch` returns; the JS only sends SIGTERM. The cache is written through a temp file unique to the
writer (`usage.json.<pid>.<n>.tmp`, then renamed) rather than the JS's shared `usage.json.tmp`.
Concurrent `orch` refreshes therefore cannot clobber each other's or the JS's temp file. Two JS
writers still can.

## Fixture provenance

`testdata/json/*.golden` are generated by `node testdata/json/gen.mjs` (last run with Node
v26.5.1) from the `*.json` inputs beside them: `<name>.compact.golden` is
`JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(input))` and `<name>.indent2.golden` the same with indent 2, without a
trailing newline. Regenerate after adding an input and commit inputs and goldens together.

`testdata/usage/*.golden` are generated by `node testdata/usage/gen.mjs` through the JS
normalizers, from the redacted feed recordings beside them (no tokens, no account identifiers).
